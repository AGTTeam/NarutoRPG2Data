Below are instructions on how to use this hack to obtain the Wi-Fi unlockable characters. For instructions on how to apply this hack to the game, please scroll down to "Patching Instructions".

- Obtain Kakashi & Jiraiya: Talk to Anko at the Main Arena (とうぎじょう) at any point in the game. She will give you Kakashi and Jiraiya's Ninja Tags (忍しきふだ), which can be used from the inventory once the game has been cleared.

- Obtain Ino & Hinata: To obtain these characters, you need to acquire the Ninja Flower: Valeriana (しのびばな・ハナシノブ) from a chest in the Land of Fire Border. Then, give the flower to either Ino OR Hinata at the Leaf Village in exchange for their Ninja Tag. Use the Tag to recruit the character, then talk to Konohamaru on the rooftop of the Ninja Academy. He will provide you with another flower which can be used to recruit the second character. (If you have not yet obtained the flower/used the first Ninja Tag, you will not receive anything.)

- Obtain Shino & Tenten: To obtain these characters, you need to acquire the Secret Ninjutsu Catalog (木ノ葉ひでん忍術ずかん) from a chest in Orochimaru's Hideout. Then, follow the steps above, substituting the Flower for the Catalog, and Ino/Hinata for Shino/Tenten.

If this is your first time patching a game, we recommend taking a quick look at our beginner's guide before continuing. https://agtteam.tumblr.com/beginnersguide

You can either patch the game online, or locally by downloading an additional piece of software. Note that you cannot apply this patch onto the original game cartridge.

                         ============================
                                ONLINE METHOD        
                         ============================

-Visit https://www.romhacking.net/patch/

-For the "ROM File", upload your copy of the unpatched game as an '.nds' filetype.
  (This should show you a CRC32 value of 73913b7b. If not, please check the file you have uploaded and make sure it’s not a .zip/.7z/.rar file etc., and that the game has not already been patched.)

-For the "Patch file" choose the 'RPG2_AllCharsPatch.xdelta' file.

-Click "Apply Patch", and wait for the download to complete. You should now have a patched copy of the ROM, labelled '-input source- (patched)'. If you are unsure how to use this file, please continue down to "Running the Game".

*If you have an account at ROMhacking.net, you can also apply the patch online from its download page. First, navigate to "Patch Online NOW!" under the 'Links' header (only visible to registered users).

                         ===========================
                               SOFTWARE METHOD      
                         ===========================

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/

-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite.

-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM as an '.nds' filetype.

-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'RPG2_AllCharsPatch.xdelta' file.

-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!

*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you'd like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick "Backup original file". This will create a new '--PATCHED.nds' file instead.
