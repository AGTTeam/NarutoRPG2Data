                   *****************************************

If this is your first time patching a game, we recommend taking a quick look at our beginner's guide before continuing. https://agtteam.tumblr.com/beginnersguide

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game using a legal copy of the ROM, which you must supply yourself. (Note that you cannot patch the translation onto the original game cartridge.)

You can either patch the game online, or locally by downloading an additional piece of software.

                         ============================
                                ONLINE METHOD        
                         ============================

-Visit https://www.romhacking.net/patch/

-For the "ROM File", upload your copy of the unpatched game as an '.nds' filetype.
  (This should show you a CRC32 value of 73913b7b. If not, please check the file you have uploaded and make sure it's not a .zip/.7z/.rar file etc., and that the game has not already been patched.)

-For the "Patch file", upload your chosen version of the 'RPG2Patch_***voice.xdelta' patch.

-Click "Apply Patch", and wait for the download to complete. You should now have a patched copy of the ROM, labelled '-input source- (patched)'. If you are unsure how to use this file, please continue down to "Running the Game".

*If you have an account at ROMhacking.net, you can also apply the patch online from its download page. First, navigate to "Patch Online NOW!" under the 'Links' header (only visible to registered users). Then follow the above steps, choosing which patch you'd like to apply from the dropdown menu.

                         ===========================
                               SOFTWARE METHOD      
                         ===========================

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/

-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite.

-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM as an '.nds' filetype.

-For 'XDelta patch', choose your preferred audio option of the two 'RPG2Patch_***voice.xdelta' files.

-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!

*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you'd like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick "Backup original file". This will create a new '--PATCHED.nds' file instead.

                   *****************************************
                   *         II. Running the Game          *
                   *****************************************

You can play the patched game on the hardware or emulator of your choice.

                         ===========================
                                 ON HARDWARE        
                         ===========================

To play the game on the original NDS/DS Lite, you will need to purchase an extra piece of hardware called a flashcart (alt. flashcard), which looks like a DS game cartridge and includes a slot for a MicroSD card. There are also carts compatible with the DSi and 2/3DS models, so please look before you buy.

Alternatively, if you own a DSi or 2/3DS, you have the option of installing custom firmware (CFW) and a DS Game Forwarder such as TWiLight Menu++ to load DS games directly from your console's internal SD card.

See https://dsi.cfw.guide/ (DSi) or https://3ds.hacks.guide/ (2/3DS) for more information and instructions.

                         ===========================
                                 VIA EMULATOR       
                         ===========================

DS emulators are available on a range of hardware, including PC, mobile and other game consoles. See below for a list of the most popular recommended emulators.

Windows 7+, Mac OS, Linux, Steam Deck - MelonDS

Android – DraStic

iOS - RetroArch

Nintendo Switch – MelonDS (You will need to install custom firmware on a compatible Switch first.)

=CHEATS=
The patch comes with two translated cheats files ready to be used with the emulators MelonDS or DeSmuME if so desired (MelonDS_cheats.mch and DeSmuME_cheats.dct respectively). The codes can also be used with other emulators/flashcarts, however may require you to do some additional setup first. Please consult a guide relating to your specific software for instructions on what to do.


=NAME CHANGES=
Due to space limitations, some jutsu/item names had to be cut down so do not match their Path of the Ninja counterparts. This is unlikely to be changed in future versions.


=RETROACHIEVEMENTS=
A set of RetroAchievements (for use with compatible emulators) has been created by team member LaytonLoztew and can be found at https://retroachievements.org/game/15481 

For a list of compatible emulators, please visit https://retroachievements.org/download.php


=UNLOCK ALL CHARACTERS=
Some characters in the game require Wi-Fi to unlock. One workaround is to use the "Unlock all characters" cheat code provided in the translated cheat files. 

This cheat code will instantly unlock all characters. Due to the potential for bugs/crashes, we do not advise using it before clearing the game.

For those who want to unlock all characters manually/without cheats (for RetroAchievements, etc.), a second workaround has been created:

- Obtain Kakashi & Jiraiya: Talk to Anko at the Main Arena at any point in the game. She will give you Kakashi and Jiraiya's Ninja Tags, which can be used from the inventory once the game has been cleared.

- Obtain Ino & Hinata: To obtain these characters, you need to acquire the Ninja Flower: Valeriana from a chest in the Land of Fire Border. Then, give the flower to either Ino OR Hinata at the Leaf Village in exchange for their Ninja Tag. Use the Tag to recruit the character, then talk to Konohamaru on the rooftop of the Ninja Academy. He will provide you with another flower which can be used to recruit the second character. (If you have not yet obtained the flower/used the first Ninja Tag, you will not receive anything.)

- Obtain Shino & Tenten: To obtain these characters, you need to acquire the Secret Ninjutsu Catalog from a chest in Orochimaru's Hideout. Then, follow the steps above, substituting the Flower for the Catalog, and Ino/Hinata for Shino/Tenten.

A ROM hack allowing this workaround to be used without changing the language of the game is also available and can be download from ROMhacking.net.


=NINJA ACADEMY MESSAGES=
In the original game, messages from Japanese fans could be found spread throughout the Ninja Academy. Rather than translate these directly, we used the opportunity to ask members of our Discord server to submit their own messages, which can be read by interacting with the blue scrolls hanging on the walls in various rooms.
